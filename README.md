Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- a brief description of the JS linter you used and what rules it follows (we'll be looking at your JS files for consistency)

The application is a mine sweeper game. The player most try to avoid all "gompeis" in order to win. 
I faced a lot challenges implementing some of the requirements and was not able to get all of the requirements working for my 
application. I have commented out parts of my code that I could not get fully functioning. I learned from this assignment that
it is crucial to work on the requirements first because I spent the majority of my time creating the game and
working on that funcitonallity. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used Canvas to create the grid and game.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used flood fill for the first time.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Tried to make the application nice to look at for the user using css
