## Coloring Page

your hosting link e.g. http://a4-ncarvajalerker.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application is to allow the user to color on a canvas and save, edit, or delete the image
- challenges you faced in realizing the application, formating, using the mouse, changing color, saving the picture and having it appear
- a brief description of the JS linter you used and what rules it follows (we'll be looking at your JS files for consistency)

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I wrote my own custom GLSL shaders to use as a material for my Three.js objects.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used the mouse to change colors and draw on a canvas. Also allowed the image to be saved or cleared by the user.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I ensured that my application would run on both desktops / mobile devices by only using clicking and buttons and accessing glitch on my phone.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I followed best practices for accessibility, including providing colors and options for saving and editing.
- **Design Achievement 3**: We tested the application with n=3 users, finding that they enjoyed how it updated but wished they could change size of the brush and type of brush, or upload an image to draw ontop of.
