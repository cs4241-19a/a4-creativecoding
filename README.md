## Your Web Application Title

I spoke to Charlie on Friday about an extension, and he said I could have until the end of the weekend.

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

The goal of this application aimed to provide easy games for an individual to play whether attending a boring meeting or in a class not as exciting as Webware. The simplicity of the game requires little attention which makes it perfect for a distraction without being too distracting. The main menu would have several games that fulfill this description. Due to time constraints, I was only able to create the main menu, as well as a game called "Paddle Ball." In paddle ball the user tries to keep the ball which travels at a random speed above the paddle using left and right arrows. In the top right corner the number of times the user has managed to hit the ball is recorded, and each time another 10 is achieved the color of the ball changes. Once the counter reaches 100, though, the ball will remain at gold. The goal was to at least have one other game, likely a puzzle with drag and drop features, but I did not have the time once I had come up with the idea.

My biggest challenges revolved primarily around time and ideas. Having had a difficult week in my personal life, I did not feel very inspired to create an exciting game, and could not think of anything interesting to create. On top of the difficulty in coming up with the idea for a series of games, I found myself with very little time between juggling classes, field hockey, and other issues. For the most part their were few technical difficulties due to the simplicity of my design, but I would have liked to include another game and a database for high scores. 

The JS linter I used was already included in my IDE. JS Lint from Webstorm was surprisingly helpful. It was a little difficult getting used to every complaint it made because it preferred semicolons, no spaces within parentheses, 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a 2D game that required the response of the user, the interaction of two different objects, and the updating of some other objects such as the counter.


### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I created a home page for the user to choose which game they would like to play. 
- **Design Achievement 2**: I added fun features to the game that would encourage the user to want to achieve a higher score including a counter as well as colors of the ball assigned to certain scores.
- **Design Achievement 3**: The application, in addition to the game, includes a button to return to the home screen, and the user can click the try again button when they lose which will only appear when a loss is registered.
