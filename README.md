## Description
The goal of the application was to make a survival mini-game using canvas. I had difficulty knowing where to begin as there are so many ways to do the same task and spent too much time going down rabbit holes. As a result, I was not able to complete all of the assignment's requirements. I had some difficulty resetting the canvas for the replay button, but I just had to make sure I reset all of my variables. I used ESLint in Visual Studio Code. I selected the JavaScript Standard Style. Some notable rules are the 2 spaces (instead of 4) for each indent, no semi-colons, and spaces in parameters.

## Technical Achievements
- **Sound**: I used the HTML5 audio element to manage the background music.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Bootstrap**: I implemented Bootstrap for the start page's text and buttons
- **Font Awesome**: I linked to Font Awesome icons for my play and tutorial buttons
