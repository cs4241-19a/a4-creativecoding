This application was just me experimenting with sounds using web audio. I wasn't sure where i was going with the project,
and after messing around with varying pitch and tone, I thought I would try to simulate a musical instrument. However, my
lack of working with timbrel generation made this really hard, so I decided I would only deal in single frequency waves,
and let the user create complex waveforms by storing individual frequencies.

The user can control the pitch, gain, pan, reverb, waveform, and quantity of tones. The user can also toggle between
viewing a time-domain graph of the wave, or the frequency-domain graph.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implementation of multiple reverb environments
- **Tech Achievement 2**: My audiovisualizer uses FFT drive visualization.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I used both web audio and canvas frameworks for this project

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
