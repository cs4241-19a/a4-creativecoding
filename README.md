###Technical Achievements###
While I did not complete this project, I found that I came incredibly close to implementing the 3d game of life algorithm. I made a decent module out of it for
further use. I chose this as an academic project and while I did not overly test it, I believe I came up with a decently fast algorithm for this project.

This project is lacking the second graphics module, and a proper front end. I do not pass the information gathered by the front end to the game module,
but that is the next implementation of this project. 

The goal of this application was to test my programming skills in the flavor of a systems project and then bring it to life with animation. 
This is what I am fond of in CS.

I did not use a JS linter due to time constraints.
