## BALANCE THE CUBE

http://a4-jrbartone.glitch.me

This game is all about balancing the cube. This game uses Three.js and Physi.js to create an interactive experience
unlike any other. The user control parameters are as follows:

- Click to dismiss overlay screens
- Hold and drag the center of the plank to play
- Press D to disable bounce (also turns cube pink)
- Press A to customize your cube color
- Press S and W to deform/ stretch your plank in the x/z direction
- Press X to disable music

Keypresses don't register when you're holding the plank.
My high score is 31. The linter that I used was JSlint with webstorm. 
Mostly just enforcing the use of "" over '' and a max line length of 100. 
These linting changes are on Github but may not be showing up in the Glitch editor. 

Cube up.
