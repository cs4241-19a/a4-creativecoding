## Earthquakes in the USA

link to website: http://a4-newtownfam.glitch.me

Hey! I bet you're sitting there at your computer wondering, "I wonder if there are any Earthquakes going on in my beautiful country". Well wonder no more! This website used d3 to show you an accurate visualization of the USA with pin points of major earthquakes. In order to see more information, just over over an earthquake point. For even more information, click on the earthquake point to be redirected to a website containing all the information you will ever need to know about it! 

But that's not all! You can use the dat gui in the top right to play with the map and title configurations. The biggest challenge I had with this application was implementing D3. It is very different from any other modules I have used in the past. 

I used ES Linter with the standard rules for indentation, spacing, and single quote strings. 

Dataset was taken from earthquakes.gov

*** Issue *** 
For some reason when on glitch, the points on the map don't reload upon refresh. I couldn't figure out why, but restarting the glitch server would do the trick. 


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used geoAlbertUSA to render a functional map of the US
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I did some geographical calculations to shift the points plotted on the map to an accurate location

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I used the bulma design pattern to make the framework of the application
