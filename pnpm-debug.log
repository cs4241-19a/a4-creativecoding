      readme: "## Odd Blog\n\nhttps://a3-dandaman2.glitch.me/\n\n\nMy application for Assignment 3 is titled \"Odd Blog\" for a wingding message board. I've always been curious about the symbolic language of wingdings, and was wondering\nif the font type could be used for any kind of communication/messaging. Odd Blog is that curiosity come to life, as it's the world's first wingding messae board. Although\nthe app is meant to be used as a wingdings communication platoforms, any user can use the toggle switch at the top of the site to covert all text (even inputted text) to \nand from wingdings/english. All posts are stored in a SQLite3 database, which is persistent among sessions. \nOdd Blog uses a Google OAuth login system for post posting and reviewing posted messages. (Users can both create new posts, as well as delete their own old posts. )\n  (Sample Credentials for Testers): username: a32019Tester@gmail.com | password: giveaplease\nIn creating this site, I used the bootstrap CSS framework and w3 CSS stylesheets, in addition to adding my own styling in classes to change both the positioning and \ndisplayed language/font of elements. \n## The five middleware packages I used includes:\n - **body-parser:** For both sending and parsing JSON files as part of GET and POST requests.\n - **session:** For maintaining persistent login within user sessions (maintains even in reload).\n - **passport & OAuth:** For logging in/out of the site using Google's OAuth API.\n - **serve-favicon:** For changing the Favicon on the page tab, as well as maintaining it in the filesystem for browser lookup.\n - **cors:** For making the site CORS accessible. An example of this can be found via the path https://a3-dandaman2.glitch.me/cors-entry, \n         which retrieves a generated JSON file.\n \nThe main challenge I faced while making this project was the fact that certain browsers (such as FireFox) do not support any symbolistic non-unicode font styles/langues \nin their browser standards. This means that on those browsers all text is displayed as english, with the translator switch only changing the font styling to default. \n\n## Technical Achievements\n- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used OAuth authentication via the Google strategy to allow users to log in with their google accounts.\n- **Tech Achievement 2**: Implemented a search bar which searches all posts from the database, showing only posts with the matching text.\n- **Tech Achievement 3**: Implemented a toggle switch which translates all text (as well as typed text) to either Wingdings or english.\n- **Tech Achievement 4**: Added a warning alert to FireFox users specifying that FireFox does not support symbolic, non-unicode characters.\n- **Tech Achievement 5**: Manipulated and set custom favicon.\n- **Tech Achievement 6**: Allowed resources to be shared via CORS accessibility.\n\n### Design/Evaluation Achievements\n- **Design Achievement 1**: Implemented an interface which allowed all text on the page to be translateable. \n- **Design Achievement 2**: Created custom Odd Blog favicon.\n- **Design Achievement 3**: Allows users to directly click on post text to view it, clicking anywhere outside the post body to deselect it. \n- **Design Achievement 4**: Page is resizeable withing the browser, showing minimal text and reformatting element's positions.
