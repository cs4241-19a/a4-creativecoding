## AudiViz - A digital audio visualizer



The application I built is an audio visualizer. I was inspired to create the visualizer with two concentric rings rotating in opposite directions for effect. 

I had a lot of difficulty coming up with original ideas and ideas that would address all of the requirements of this project, yet also be a feasible project for me
to complete with the allotted time. In particular, I had a lot of difficulting with the modularization of js files, as well as "installing" a linter. I searched for an online 
JS linter and found JSLint:https://www.jslint.com/ . The settings underwhich I checked my code wereto tolerate for statements, this, and long lines (the default is to 
have 80 characters max per line). Details on the specifics of the rules followed by this linter can be found at: https://www.jslint.com/help.html , 
but the linter checked for presence of semicolons, double quotes, and flagged extra spaces (spaces between and after lines) as well as proper selective importing.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I wrote my own custom GLSL shaders to use as a material for my Three.js objects.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: My audiovisualizer uses both FFT and amplitude analysis to drive visualization.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I optimized the efficiency of my reaction-diffusion algorithm by...
