## Cube Play!!

your hosting link e.g. http://a4-elizabethkirschner.glitch.me

The goal of this application is to allow users to play with cubes in a 3D space.  My parameters for user control are:

1. Space: press space to change the background color of the scene
2. Orbit controls: allow you to rotate, zoom and slide around the scene
3. CLick on a cube in the scene to select it
Using dat.gui
4. Change a selected cubes length
5. change a selected cubes width
6. change a selected cubes height
7. make a selected cube a wireframe
8. change the color of a selected cube

Instructions for the non dat.gui controls appear at the top of the screen onload, they are dissmissable with shift + ? and reappear with the same command.

Challenges included understanding modules and getting started with dat.gui and three.js. I used the standard linter.  One problem i had with the linter is that it says that "requestAnimationFrame" is undefined, but as far as i know, I am not supposed to define it myself.
