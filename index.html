<p id = "bio" style = "visibility: hidden"> Production from livestock supply chains can be expressed as per protein basis, allowing comparisons between species and products. East and Southeast Asia, with about 14 million tonnes of protein, is the region with the highest production, mainly driven by monogastric species. Western Europe, North America and Latin America and the Caribbean have comparable production levels, between 9.5 and 9 million tonnes of protein. The profiles, however, are different: while beef and chicken play the main role in Latin and North America, Western Europe's production is primarily driven by the dairy cattle sector. South Asia is the fifth most important region in terms of production with just above 4 million tonnes of protein. Near East and north Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, Eastern Europe, Oceania and Russian Federation, with production between 3 and 1.5 million tonnes of protein, have a lower individual share at global scale.</br> </br> Regional total production and their profile by commodity are shown. Meat production in protein basis was calculated by using data on dressing percentages, carcass to bone-free meat and average bone-free meat protein content. Milk from all species was converted into fat and protein corrected milk. Eggs production is also expressed in protein terms.</br></br> Information and data have been modified from  <a href="http://www.fao.org/gleam/results/en/">The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations </a>. </br></br> </p>
