This project is an audio visualizer that reacts to the music that is being played. Users will be able to interact with the visualizer by adjusting the properties of the visualizer such as the color, shape and style.
The goal is to allow users to enjoy some music with an interesting view that they can modify. The JS linter that was used is JS standard style https://standardjs.com/. The rules have not been modified and can be seen on the
website provided. Before proceeding to the challenges, one challenge from last assignment that I overcame for this assignment is my poor planning. For this assignment I created a plan before creating any code and this has allowed
for a easier time. The main challenge I faced this for this assignment was getting the modules to work. I was uinable to get the modules to function properly for the submission but my attempted work can be seen in the commented
sections of main.js and shapeMaker.js. Another issue I faced was having Google Chrome to work with me. Halfway through the implementation Google chrome would no longer play the audio for the visualizer. The workaround that was 
used is to use firefox. This is probably happening due to not having a user action before playing and it conflicts with chrome's autoplay rules. If this does not work in chrome, please try again in Firefox and make sure that
autoplay is not blocked for your browser.
