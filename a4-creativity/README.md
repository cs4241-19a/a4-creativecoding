For this assignment I created a 3d game that requires the user to type in two numbers to see if the cubes back color matches. I used the base linter for atom in the dev of the app.
The application was created using three.js. The game is explanined by the information drop down that can be toggled by clicking the button and the x. Below the game is a user interface where
the user can change some of the settings of the game.
