## Audio Visualizer

https://evanbg-wpi-a4-creativecoding.glitch.me

This application visualizes the frequencies in a piece of music. 
The volume of any given frequency is represented by a bar on one of the visualizer items. 
The main challenge of this app was learning how to work with the Web Audio API to extract the frequency data from the audio.
For this project I used JetBrains' WebStorm and its built-in linting.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: My audio visualizer uses an FFT analyzer for frequency analysis.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I broke the frequencies out into three groups to better visualize an overall piece of music.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I added calculations to change the color and size of the visuals based on amplitude and average amplitude across frequency ranges

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I created a simple but effective menu using dat.gui
- **Design Achievement 2**: I used circles and bars for my visualizer objects, creating a more artistic representation.
- **Design Achievement 3**: I determined the best frequency ranges to use by testing my analyzer on different types of music.
