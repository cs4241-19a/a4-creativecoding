## Your Web Application Title

- The goal of this application was to compare video games sales in different countries, and see how certain games sold differently across the globe.
- The hardest part was learning D3, since I have never used it before. I had to take several tutorials and had quite a few headaches getting even simple things to work correctly.
- The JS Linter I used was ESLint, it follows the default rules. I used it mostly for checking for unused and nonexistant variables. I found it to be quite helpful when coding.
- One bug I have is my x axis dissapears when the max or min sales is changed. I had it working but it stopped at some point along the way and I was unable to find the fix for this.
- In the future I would like to add other console sales (since this is just PS4) and present the data in a bit more interesting way 

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used a kaggle dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset that I transferred to a JSON format
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used D3 to create a chart and graphed the points from my dataset based on their sales and year of release
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I used dat.GUI to edit my D3 visualization, which required redrawing certain parts of the graph as they changed
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I developed a simple algorithm to map a sales value of a point to a RGB value that I used in my design

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I developed a custom color generator depending on the value of the node in the graph
- **Design Achievement 2**: I created custom a custom axis for the year so it would only display Integers
- **Design Achievement 3**: I added a hover feature that changes the opacity of points when the mouse is over them, and shows a tooltip of what game you are looking at as well as the sales for that game
- **Design Achievement 2**: I went for a very clean design that had components that are fun and satisfying to mess with
