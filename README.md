## Sine Wave Visualizer

Glitch link: http://amarkoski-a4-amarkoski.glitch.me/

The goal of this application is to plot an oscillating sine wave and allow users to modify different properties to see how they affect the wave. A help menu is available to explain what each interactive parameter represents. These parameters include amplitude, frequency, phase shift, vertical shift, speed, and color. This web app uses HTML canvas and dat.gui. The main challenge I faced in this application was getting the sine wave to move and animate smoothly. This was accomplished by keeping track of an incrementing shift value and redrawing the wave shifted over horizontally.

The JS linter I used was standard.js through a Visual Studio Code plugin. It follows rules related to reducing uneccessary white space before and after blocks of code. It does not prefer semicolons at the end of statements. It also checks that variables are used after they are declared and also that variables are declared before they are used.

Dependencies:
npm install:
  - express
  - compression
