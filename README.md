Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I wrote my own custom GLSL shaders to use as a material for my Three.js objects.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: My audiovisualizer uses both FFT and amplitude analysis to drive visualization.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: I optimized the efficiency of my reaction-diffusion algorithm by...
- **Tech Achievement 4**: I visualized the dataset X using three different visualization technqiues provided by D3, andprovided

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I ensured that my application would run on both desktops / mobile devices by changing X
- **Design Achievement 2**: I followed best practices for accessibility, including providing alt attributes for images and using semantic HTML. There are no `<div>` or `<span>` elements in my document.
- **Design Achievement 3**: We tested the application with n=X users, finding that...
