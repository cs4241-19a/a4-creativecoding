For this project,  I explored with the 3D shaders, lighting effects and the GUI.The shape of all the objects was an exploration for me as well. 
- Goal of the Application: to create a somewhat pretty, UI while allowing interactions from the user.
- I had a hard time learning all the things that three.js has to offer and wish i could have explored more. 
- I used the linter mentioned in the class notes. the standard.js
