Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application create a visual audio app that allows users to choose instruments and 
click on the screen to choose notes and octave.
- challenges you faced in realizing the application was learning to use tone.js and canvas together.
- a brief description of the JS linter you used and what rules it follows (we'll be looking at your JS files for consistency)
<br> I used the jslint that was built into webstorm. I assumed the allowed use of this, for statements, multiple var statements, and single quote strings.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used tone.js to use web audio api in a better way. This allowed me to create notes, and octaves for each click. <br>
This also allowed to give the user choice of instrument.
