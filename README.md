## Helix App

This application creates pretty visuals with user interaction. The logic was inspired by hierarchy models, which creates a sequence that's similar to a helix. With the controls, you can modify size, angles, and the background. Biggest issue I faced was trying to use Glitch with the linter and the module system, which I failed miserably.
Used ESLint at WebStorm but carried the final project to Glitch in the end.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Wrote logic for controls.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: The beautiful FPS tracker from Stats library (from examples).

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Validated HTML/CSS.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Pretty Visuals.
