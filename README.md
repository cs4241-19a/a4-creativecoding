In the a video game arcade, the rhythm game machine that reigned supreme would have to be Dance Dance Revolution. This
phenomenon soon spread to homes through the Playstation consoles and as a child, I also had the pleasure of owning on of
these titles. As the years have passed, the game has faded in popularity but the genre still draws fans regularly. There
are a few clones of this game for the PC the most notable of which is Stepmania, a C++ based desktop app. When it comes 
to online versions, however, there are few quality implementations. My goal for this project was to create a DDR-like
rhythm game that could be fully accessible through a webpage. The current implementation involves the usage of D3.js and
a few Stepmania files converted to JSON to demonstrate a functional framework for such a rhythm game. This rhythm game
was hard to develop mostly due to the timing and generation needed for the game events. This project uses D3.timer to
control the movement of the arrows and keyboard events (namely, the arrow keys) to interact with the game state. It uses
the linter "JSLint" through the Webstorm IDE with the rules "ES6", "a browser" and "Node.js" selected. 
 

## Technical Achievements
- Uses event-triggering and timing-based events in the functionality of the rhythm game
- Keeps track of life, score, and a combo meter (only the score is currently visible)
- Game selection

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- Uses d3 to implement the game graphics
- Custom game logo(A Bard's Tale)
- Multiple track selection with various background images
- Uses HTML5 Audio to play music, controllable through the user interface
