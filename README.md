## Tip, Tap, Type

This application is a typing game. Users race the clock to type words before they disappear!

- The goal of the application is to allow users to practice their typing skills in a fun way.
- I used eslint and chose to use their Standard linting library.
It enforces single quotes, no semicolons, 2-space indents, single line initialization,
no spaces within parentheses, space before function parentheses

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used WebGL for 2D transformations.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I used typed.js for the title of the website, https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I tested the game with 7 users. User feedback led to features such as game level,
lives, sound effects, clearing the input field when a word was typed correctly, displaying pill badges to allow users
to quickly identify the modes of the current game.
