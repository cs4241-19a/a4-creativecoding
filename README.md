## Planetarium

I asked Prof. Roberts for an extension and he allowed me an extra day to work on the assigment with no penalty.

My project is a 3D view of the planets in the solar system. The user can interact with the program by pausing, changing brightnes, render size, zoom, movement, and can also choose a planet to see it's diameter. This project was made using three.js and implements helemt and compressions middleware as well as two modules for the modal (instructions) and the creation of the planets. 

A big challenge I had was with the modules. I couldn't get my module.exports to work because I was missing a few lines in my eslintrc.json file. I spent a lot of time trying to fix this issue and it took me a few days to problem solve and finally figure out the issue. I'm used to using one js file and scripts in the html file so modules was a slightly newer experience for me.

I used ESLint along with the prettier plug-in to keep my code consistent. Prettier autoformatted all of my code so that it followed consistently accepted javascript, html, and css convention. ESlint was used to enforce the usage of all variables at least once and the usage of semi-colons.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Implemnted Three.js to display several moving gemoetries at varying speeds and locations
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Used ESLint and prettier to keep code more consistent and readable.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Used current time and sine functions to determine position of planets in solar system

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Utilized flexboxes to make buttons and directions. Allowed for better control of ui and easier access to getting elements by ID.
- **Design Achievement 2**: Used little to no scripting in the html file by utilizing my modules to create the modals and planets.
- **Design Achievement 3**: Tested site on mulitple browsers (since my last project did not work well on edge) to ensure that it worked well on any browser
