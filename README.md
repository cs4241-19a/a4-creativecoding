## Shape Generator

https://a4-cbennet-cooper-bennet.glitch.me

This site uses user input to generate a rotating 3D shape. 
One challenge I faced was a minor bug wiht perspective camera in three,js, it sometimes throws errors if the camera is not initialized globally.
I Used JShint, an online linter, to check my .js files

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: only event listeners were used to ensure the page dynamically updates whenever a change is made
- **Tech Achievement 1**: the speed of the rotation can be changed without rerendering the shape

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: The display is fit to window when rendered so it can handle different screen sizes with little loss
