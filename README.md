## 3D using Three.js

your hosting link e.g. https://a4-calemdar.glitch.me/

For this project I wanted to play around with 3D shaders, lighting effects and GUI

- wanted to have have multiple inputs that change the 3D objects
- Couldn't figure out adding/removing/changing light sources in Three.js
- Tried to structure Three.js but naming some variables anything other than "var" gave errors
- Tried to do everything on top of a single index.html element

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I wrote my own custom GLSL shader but couldn't attach it to cubes or the background
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Used dat.gui to change parameters 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Used stats to show FPS count

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Added multiple directional light sources, couldn't get to change the color
- **Design Achievement 2**: Created an overlay <div> over the canvas element, but ended up using dat.gui for all UI elements
