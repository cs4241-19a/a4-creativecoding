Tic-Tac-Toe With Canvas Scoreboard
=================

http://a4-sean-dandeneau.glitch.me

My project is a simple game of tic-tac-toe with user click interaction. Additionally, users are able to customize a scoreboard below the game that is generated on canvas.

The goal of the application was to create a easy to play tic-tac-toe game with user customization.

Learning to use canvas and formatting the text was the hardest part of the application.
