## Ken's Generation I Pokédex

http://a4-kendesrosiers.glitch.me

As a lifelong Pokémon fan, once I found that this was a possible dataset I had to use it. The goal of this application was to create a fun, interactive pokédex for the first generation of pokémon. I had some issues with D3.js at first, like not being able not use an existing div when creating one for each piece of data. Also, the example Professor Roberts did in class used an array of key:value pairs, while this dataset was an array of objects, so I couldn't base mine off of the class example. I used StandardJS, which I got through VS Code. Some rules it follows are no semicolons, a space between 'if' and the parenthesis, brackets on the same line as the function declaration, and using const whenever a variable isn't reassigned. One thing I learned is do NOT save the linting until the end, it takes a VERY long time.

## Technical Achievements
- **Filtering**: Not only can the data be filtered by multiple parameters, they all work in relation to each other.
- **Bootstrap**: I used the bootstrap framework to organize some information.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Modals**: I used modals to neatly show the pokémon data as well as the help menu.
- **Light/Dark mode**: I implemented a way for the user to switch between light and dark mode.
- **Change song**: The user is also able to switch the currently playing song.
