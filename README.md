## Virtual Trombone

http://a4-kdreese.glitch.me

The project would consist of a "disembodied" trombone on screen. The main body would exist for visual purposes and the slide would be the first of the six parameters of sound distortion. Moving the slide away from the main body of the instrument would decrease the pitch, while moving it toward the main body of the instrument would increase the pitch. Other sliders would chance dynamics, tone, and what octave the instrument is in. The final two parameters would be sliders for color changing and size modularity, just for aesthetic purposes. The sound and picture would be controlled by Web Audio API.
