Goal of the application:
Tests out your spatial skills by comparing different values from a bar/pie chart.


## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: Made red arrow indicators…..
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Zoom/Pan
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Reset Button
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Displayed whether or not user was correct at the end

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: For our design achievements, red arrow indicators were added to show the user which two parts of the graph was being compared. These arrows would move up and down in order to catch the attention of the users and provide an aesthetic using animation. However, in order to not draw too much attention away from the actual graph, the arrows were smaller and only moves a moderate amount.
- **Design Achievement 2**: The graphs are contained within a box so that the user knows the boundaries of the viewing area. 
- **Design Achievement 3**: Users can zoom and pan the graph to their liking in order to have different views of the graph to compare. This allows them the freedom to get as close of a comparison as they can without necessarily giving them the ability to figure out the answer.
- **Design Achievement 4**: In order to make our reset feature seem more fluid, an animation will play re-scaling and moving the graph back to their default attributes along with the arrows. This will ensure a sense of immersion through solidarity and level transformation. This works well when the user decides to be funny and finds out they can no longer view the graph due to excessive panning or zooming into the wrong areas.

- **Design Achievement 5**: The table at the end are for users to see their own reported percentages compared to the actual percentages of the questions. The table also reports whether or not the user is correct by checking their answers within a +/-2 range of actual percentage. The color of the “Correct” and “Incorrect” words are colored green and red respectively in order for the user to more easily identify which ones that were wrong.
