# Sticker Creator

## Overview

I am a frequent user of the site [Redbubble](www.redbubble.com). It is a print on demand site that allows creators to upload their own designs and shoppers buy their artowrk on various products, most commonly stickers. A lot of the time, the artwork is plain text with an overlayed background. Most people want to create their own stickers for their laptops, notebooks, cars, or whatever they can think of, but don't have the time or experience to create something like this in an editor like gimp or photoshop. My site solves this problem.

## Use Case

1. User enters stickerText
2. User selects a font
3. User selects a font size
4. User selects a color or a background
5. User enters an email
6. User clicks submit and receives an email with their image.

## Technological Acheivements

1. **Node Mailer** - Node Mailer sends user an email of their created sticker
2. **LowDB** - Used JSON DB to create a list of all orders

## Design Acheivements

1. **Mobile Friendly** - Used CSS framework to create responsive layout and use native controls.
2. **Materialize** - Used material design framework. Effective use of shadows, colors, and layers to make the site pop.
3. **Responsive Layouts** - Used Materialize to make a responsive layout that adapts to the resolution of the screen.
