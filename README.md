This is a data visualization consists of 2 linked charts rendered using D3.js. 

To fulfill the requirements:
---
### Six user controls:
- Tooltip:
- Linked views on hover:
- Brushing (pan and zoom)

### Linter:

- I used the built-in linter in Webstorm.
- The JS Linter tolerates: for statement, multiple vars, single quote strings, this, whitespace mess, eval, bitwise operators 
- It assumes: ES6, Node.js
- Maximum line length: 100
- Maximum number of error: 50


### General: 

- I included both helmet and compression packages in my server.
- I have two modules named mod1.js and mod2.js. 
- My HTML and CSS files are validated.  
- The dismissable and redisplay documentation can be triggered using the "Read Documentation" button.


Goals:
---
- My goal was to create a highly interactive and responsive visualization for the most popular movie genres produced between 2000 and 2018. I think I was successful in doing that. I had multiple interactions and users could freely play around with them.


Main Challenges:
---
- I had the most problems using dat.GUI and putting my codes into modules. 



Implications:
---
- anything broken?


Achievements:
---


### Technical:
- 



### Design:
- Used the Type.js library for aesthetics. 
- I hard coded all the styling.
