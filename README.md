## James Scherick's John Conway's Game of Life

your hosting link e.g. http://a4-jamesscherick.glitch.me

My project is a website that runs John Conway's Game of Life. You can set many paramaters like size of each node and how many nodes there are in each direction. You can also set how many frames it takes to itterate one step of the simulation. It was fairly challenging figuring out how to do the import/export modules, but that was mostly because I was being stupid and did not properly read the tutorial. 
I used npx standard for my linter, here are a list of some of the rules. 2 space indents, single quotes for strings, no unused variables, add space after keywords, add a space before a function declaration's parentheses, and many more. a complete list of rules can be found at https://standardjs.com/rules.html

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I thought it would be nice for users to be able to save the paterns they find most interesting, so there is a way to save and name boards.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I created some pre-saved boards to show a user some of the cool things that can be done with this generational algarithum. While I found big explosion from another website. small explosion and huge explosion were both things I have created. Not saying they have never been done before but just that I found them on my own by playing arround with the algarithum. This actully took quite a bit of time because after finding something cool I had to remeber how to recreate the start of it, so I could save it.
- **Design Achievement 2**: I dont know if this counts as a design achievent because it was really easy to impliment. But I have always wanted a randomize feature for other websites that have The Game of Life, so I knew from the start I was going to impliment one here so I could see what it does. It was cool to see how a randomlly generated system looks.
